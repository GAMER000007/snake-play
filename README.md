# snake-play
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, with the player controlling the snake's direction using arrow keys. The objective is to navigate the snake, avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself.
